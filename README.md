# angular4-webpack-minimal-seed
This is a real minimal `angular4` seed project with production ready `webpack2` config. There isn't any other javascript dependency that just angular with its respective polyfills. <br>
Ideal for mount a quick base project if you have knowledge to add more dependencies. You won't lose hours dealing with unknown dependencies. <br> <br>


## Pre-requisites
- Firstly, install node.js in your computer: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/
- Later, install globally following programs: ```npm install webpack webpack-dev-server -g```

## Installation and Initialization
Now, move inside the project folder and run:
- ```npm install``` (to install all dependencies listed on package.json)<br> 

After that, you can use following commands:

- ```npm start``` (watch changes and start a webpack dev server on http://localhost:2000)
- ```npm run watch``` (just watch changes)
- ```npm run build``` (build to production UNIX/LINUX)
- ```npm run build-win``` (build to production WINDOWS)

# angular5-webpack3-minimal-seed
This is a real minimal `angular5` seed project with production ready `webpack3` config. There isn't any other javascript dependency that just angular with its respective polyfills. <br>
Ideal for mount a quick base project if you have knowledge to add more dependencies. You won't lose hours dealing with unknown dependencies. <br> <br>

## Pre-requisites
- Firstly, install node.js in your computer: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/
- Later, install globally following programs: ```npm install webpack webpack-dev-server -g```

## Installation and Initialization
Now, move inside the project folder and run:
- ```npm install``` (to install all dependencies listed on package.json)<br> 

After that, you can use following commands:

|Command|Description|
|:--:|:----------|
|**```npm start```**|Watch changes and start a webpack dev server on http://localhost:3000|
|**```npm start```**|Only watch changes|
|**```npm start```**|Build to production|


## Pending tasks/work:
- [ ] Improve docs specifing all features on the seed project.
- [ ] Add angular AOT compilation.
